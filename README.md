# CS412 PS5b

To run program locally, run `node PS4/app.js` (This PS is extended from PS4, so I kept the API root the same)

To run the get request simply type `http://localhost:3000/ps4` in your browser. It should show the default form to search for GIFs.

After submitting the form, the program returns a GIF that corresponds with the GIF!
